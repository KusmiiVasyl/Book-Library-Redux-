Book Library App

The possibility of adding books to the list in three ways has been developed: manually, randomly (from the list of books that are in the program in the json list) and randomly from the server (a simple server has been created on node.js). You can also delete a book from the added list of books, mark it as a favorite. Made it possible to filter books by title, author and favorite. All states are rendered in redux, if an error occurs a message appears in the upper right window of the screen.
